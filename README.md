# Vehicle Trajectory Tracking with Kalman Filtering Methods

This repository presents a MATLAB-based research project on vehicle trajectory tracking
using classical model-based and modern learning-based Kalman filtering techniques.

## Project Overview

A realistic driving scenario is generated using MATLAB’s `drivingScenario` framework.
From this scenario, noisy position measurements are extracted and processed using three different tracking approaches:

1. Traditional IMM Kalman Filter (CV / CA)
2. Trajectory-Based Tracking (Ground-Truth Driven)
3. Unsupervised Learning-Based Adaptive Kalman Filter (KF-CA + RNN)

## Traditional IMM (CV / CA)

A classical Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Kalman filter using two motion models:

- CV (Constant Velocity)
- CA (Constant Acceleration)

### Trajectory-Based Tracking

- Uses the known trajectory structure generated by the driving scenario
- Serves as a reference for visualization and benchmarking

### Unsupervised Adaptive KF

A learning-based approach that does not require ground-truth states for training.

Key features:

- Constant Acceleration (CA) Kalman Filter
- RNN learns:
  - Process noise intensity
  - Measurement noise scaling

RNN inputs:
- Normalized innovation
- Normalized measurement
- Normalized time step
  
## Evaluation Metrics

- **RMSE** – Root Mean Square Error
- **MAE** – Mean Absolute Error
- **Maximum Error**
- **Bias** per axis
- **Mean NIS** (Normalized Innovation Squared, consistency check)
- **Rejected updates** using NIS-based gating
